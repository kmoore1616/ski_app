This app tracks your ski day activites! It consists of three main screens, a login, a entry page, and a summary page.
To enter a day, go to the "Enter Ski Day" tab and enter in your day. Select a day from the list to update or delete it. 
To see a summary of your entries, click the "Summary" tab. Here your total stats are listed as well as a cleaner view of your days.
Filter by vertical with the slider on the right of the window.
You can print this to a tsv by clicking the print button on the top right of the summary page, it will be saved to the root of the project directory as
summary.tsv.
